This repository contains the prototypes developed for the Entropy presentation. 

Note that most of these applications are unfinished proofs-of-concept, so run at your own risk!

## Setup

Coming soon! 

If you're eager to get your hands dirty:

1. Clone [openFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks).
2. Clone [EntropyPrototypes](https://github.com/Entropy/EntropyPrototypes) into the `openFrameworks/apps/` folder.
3. Try running some projects.
4. You'll probably need some addons like [ofxHDF5](https://github.com/Entropy/ofxHDF5), [ofxImGui](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui), [ofxMSAOpenCL](https://github.com/memo/ofxMSAOpenCL), etc.

A more complete setup procedure will be up shortly. Thank you for your patience.
